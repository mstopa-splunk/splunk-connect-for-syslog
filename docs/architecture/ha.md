Load balancing for high availability does not work well for stateless, unacknowledged syslog traffic. More data is preserved when you use a more simple design such as vMotioned VMs.  With syslog, the protocol itself is prone to loss, and syslog data collection can be made "mostly available" at best.

The best deployment model for high availability is a [Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) based deployment with MetalLB in BGP mode. This model uses a special class of load balancer that is implemented as destination network translation.
